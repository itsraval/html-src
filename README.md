# html-src
This program checks if a website is been updated since "html-src" is being launched.

# What you can do
"html-src" will check every 5 minutes the url you choosed until the page will be updated or if you close the program.
You can save url so you don't need to write it everytime.
You can delete url if you don't need it anymore.

# To do
You have to set the variable "fileLocation" (line 8) with the location of your csv file. If there is no file the program will make it.
