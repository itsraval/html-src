# html-src
This program checks if a website is been updated since "html-src" is being launched.

# What you can do
"html-src" will check every 5 minutes the url you choosed until the page will be updated or if you close the program.
You can save urls (in app) so you don't need to write them everytime.
You can delete urls (in app) if you don't need them anymore.

# To do
You have to set the variable "fileLocation" (line 8) with the location of your csv file to be able to save urls. If there is no file the program will make it.
